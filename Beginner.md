When Bob and Jia were thrown into the world of cybersecurity, they didn't know anything- and thus were very overwhelmed. They're trying to make sure it doesn't happen to you.

Let's cover some bases first.

### Solution: 
Get real used to CyberChef.  First of all, it’s awesome and you should use it. Second..see the first point.  Most of these challenges can be done by just using the “Magic” recipe.  We’ll do it the right way for the sake of longwindedness.

Don't go around bashing people.

### Solution: 
Team mate solved this one. Not sure how he got to it, but you need to swap Z with A, Y with B, etc.  Use the “substitute” recipe and plaintext “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz’ with the ciphertext “zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba”.  After writing the solution I did some research and its simply called an Atbash cipher, which is also in CyberChef.
